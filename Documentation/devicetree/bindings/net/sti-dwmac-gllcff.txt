STMicroelectronics GLLCFF SoC DWMAC glue layer controller

This file documents differences between the core properties in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/stmmac.txt
and what is needed on STi platforms to program the stmmac glue logic.

The device node has following properties.

Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/stmmac.txt for optional and
required properties needed for the main and platform part.

Required properties:
 - compatible:
	- "st,gllcff-dwmac0" for GMAC0
	- "st,gllcff-dwmac1" for GMAC1
 - phys: phandle to an external phy
 - phy-names: must be "gmac-phy"
 - phy-mode: can be "mii" or "gmii"
Optional properties:
 - snps,phy-addr: Indicate the ID of the Embedded PHY
 - disable-pcs: Disable PCS.
 - disable-fcs: Strip FCS from frames.

Example:

ethernet0: dwmac@16800000 {
	device_type = "network";
	compatible = "st,gllcff-dwmac";
	reg = <0x16800000 0x10000>;
	reg-names = "stmmaceth";

	reset-names = "stmmaceth";

	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 85 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>,
		     <GIC_SPI 84 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>,
		     <GIC_SPI 83 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
	interrupt-names = "macirq", "eth_wake_irq", "eth_lpi";

	phy-names = "gmac-phy";
	phy-mode = "gmii";
	snps,phy-addr = <0x2>;
	phys = <&ephy PHY_NONE>;

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_mdio1>;

	resets = <&softreset GGLCFF_FC7_RST_GMAC_1_APP_N>;
	reset-names = "stmmaceth";

	clock-names = "stmmaceth", "pclk", "ptp_ref";
	clocks = <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_PTP_REF_GMAC_0>,
		 <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_PERIPH_1>,
		 <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_PTP_REF_GMAC_0>;

	snps,pbl = <8>;

	power-domains = <&gmac1_fcgate>;

	status = "disabled";
};
